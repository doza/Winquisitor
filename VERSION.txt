VERSION 0.1.5
=====================
- Changed the --result-detail switch so that it applies to tests other than
    -cq (--custom-query). This will now display detailed properties and values
    where appropriate. Currently only implemented for -pr (--process) test.
    Will implement for the other tests at a later date.
- Modified winquisitor.xsl to make the output a bit more readable when
    displaying detailed results.

VERSION 0.1.4
=====================
- Fixed bug where the script would throw a weird error when run with wscript
    instead of cscript. wscript does not have StdErr so fatalError() could not
    be used. The script now uses WScript.Echo to report the script host error.

VERSION 0.1.3
=====================
- Fixed a bug that would cause the script to fail when prompting for a password
    on a non XP/2003 system while in debug mode
- Round total run time debug display to 4 decimal places so output is useful
- Moved total run time debug display so it only shows at end of script and not
    after each host

VERSION 0.1.2
=====================
- Corrected version string format bug
- Added code to prompt for passwords on non XP/2003 systems
  ** Note: The password will not be masked when typed

- Round timer debug display to 4 decimal places so output is useful

VERSION 0.1.1
=====================
- The file test now outputs the file version if the file exists
