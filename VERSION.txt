VERSION 0.1.4
=====================
- Fixed bug where the script would throw a weird error when run with wscript
    instead of cscript. wscript does not have StdErr so fatalError() could not
    be used. The script now uses WScript.Echo to report the script host error.

VERSION 0.1.3
=====================
- Fixed a bug that would cause the script to fail when prompting for a password
    on a non XP/2003 system while in debug mode
- Round total run time debug display to 4 decimal places so output is useful
- Moved total run time debug display so it only shows at end of script and not
    after each host

VERSION 0.1.2
=====================
- Corrected version string format bug
- Added code to prompt for passwords on non XP/2003 systems
  ** Note: The password will not be masked when typed

- Round timer debug display to 4 decimal places so output is useful

VERSION 0.1.1
=====================
